# 📘 Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

This repository contains my complete practice and implementation of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**.  
All topics are organized **package-wise** for clarity, consistency, and easy navigation.

The goal of this repository is to strengthen problem-solving skills, build strong DSA fundamentals, and prepare for **coding interviews**.
